The aim of this project is to use Python code to automate the process of scraping a website for weekly grocery offers, clean and structure the scraped data and finally load the cleaned data to a SQL database. 
The website containing the data needed is "E-reklamblad.se" which updates with new product offers in store every week. The idea is to be able to develop this project further in the future, to be continued...
